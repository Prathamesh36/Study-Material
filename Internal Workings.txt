Q.Internal working of hashset in java.
	HashSet is a class from the Collections Framework. It allows you to store multiple values in a collection using a hash table. The hash table stores the values in an unordered method with the help of hashing mechanism.
Here are the steps on how HashSet works internally in Java:
	-When you create a HashSet object, it internally creates a HashMap object.
	-Whenever you add an element to the HashSet, the element's hash code is calculated.
	-The hash code is then used to determine which bucket in the hash table the element should be stored in.
	-The element is then stored in the bucket.
	-If you try to add an element that is already in the HashSet, the element will not be added again.
	-When you iterate over the HashSet, the elements are returned in no particular order.
