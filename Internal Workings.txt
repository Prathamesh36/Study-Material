Q.Internal working of hashset in java.
	-HashSet is a class from the Collections Framework. 
	-HashSet internally uses HashMap to store it's elements.
	-Whenever you create a HashSet object, one HashMap object associated with it is also created. This HashMap object is 	 used to store the elements you enter in the HashSet.
	-Whenever you add an element to the HashSet, the element's hash code is calculated using hashcode() function.
	-The hash code is then used to determine which bucket in the hash table the element should be stored in.
	-The elements you add into HashSet are stored as keys of this HashMap object.
	-If you try to add an element that is already in the HashSet, the element will not be added again.
	-The value associated with those keys will be a constant.
