Inheritance: It is a mechanism to access the properties( data members and methods) of another class in the some other class. There are two terms in inheritance the one is parent class or base class that provides the properties to access by the another class, the class that access the properties of another is class is called child class or sub-class. 


Note: extends and implements keyword is used to access the properties of parent class. 

1) class extends class
2) class implements interface
3) interface extends interface 

class A{
  
   int a=10; 
  
   void disp(){
    
    .... logic 
}

}

class B{

    

}

here A is parent class and B is child class. 


Types of inheritance: 

1) single-level-inheritance: 
2) multi-level-inheritance 
3) hirerchical-inheritance 
4) multiple inheritance 
5) hybrid inheritance 

Note: Multiple and hybrid is possible through interface only. 

Multiple inheritance is  not supported by class it is only possible by interface due to ambiguity error, let's suppose we have same method name in parent1 and parent2 once we extends the both parent classes and if we call the disp method by the object of child class it will confuse either we have to call the parent 1 class method or parent 2 class method. 

Why not possible multiple inheritance in java? 

1. 
WAP to find the  average of only even digit from fabannoci sequence using with argument method

2. 

WAP to print only those prime element from array that some is equal to any even number 

arr1[]={11,13,24,33,31,111,101}
output: {11,13,31,101} 
explanation: 1+1=2, 1+3=4, 3+1=4

3. WAP to print those element from array that satisfied prime and palindrom both concept.  

4. WAP to rotate the matrix by 90 degree using java program

5.
