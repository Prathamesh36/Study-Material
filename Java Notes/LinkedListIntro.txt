LinkedList in java: It is the implementation class of List interface. It is the part of Collection Framework that is present in java.util package. This class is implementation of linkedlist data structure which is the linear data structure. 

> In LinkedList every element is a seprate object with the data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointer or address of the next element and previous elements. Each element is know as the node in LinkedList.

>What is node:
Ans: Node is the  data(element) + address of next element. it means nodes holds the previous element address as well as next element address.

> LinkedList devided into three parts.
(i)   Singly: In singly linkedlist node only contains the next element address.

(ii)  Doubly: In doubly LinkedList node can store previous element address as well as next element address. In double we can traverse the element in both direction i.e in forward and in backward. LinkedList class work on doubly linkedlist in java.

(iii) Circular: In Circular LinkedList, HEAD Node has the TAIL node address and TAIL NODE has the address of HEAD node that makes the circular linkedlist.

Properties of LinkedList:

(i) LinkedList class can contain duplicates element.
(ii) In LinkedList we can store multiple null value.
(iii) LinkedList class is non-synchronized.
(iv) In LinkedList class, the manupulation of data is fast because no shifting of elements.

Disadvantages of LinkedList:

(i) Memory consuption is high in LinkedList, because every node conatains the address of previous node and next node.

Note 1: LinkedList class implements deque interface also.

Note 1: There is no capacity concept in LinkedList class.
